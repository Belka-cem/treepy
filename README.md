Treepy


Treepy is a web application for students that allows users to find
people to travel with and who have the same travel plans as you to major destinations. The application is also able to follow the news of your friends and share photos of your travels. You can also communicate with your future partners and friends through email.
The selection of your future partners is made thanks to a match system with filters (type of trip, destination, budget, sex) that will allow you to find the users who best suit your research, which will allow you to live the best possible experience.
